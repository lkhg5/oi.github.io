00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
We have covered string, input string,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.610
output string, file reader, and file writer.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.675
In this video, we're going to learn buffer and buffer reader.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:14.040
Buffers is region of physical memory storage used to

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.005
temporary store data while it's being moved from one place to another.

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:23.445
The physical memory storage would be RAM, in most case.

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:31.980
For file, buffer is a storage still part of the string data fuses to output.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.675
When we use a buffer,

00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:40.125
what happen is each character is stored in buffer into memory location,

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:46.430
then converting the string of data into a single solid value.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.955
Java BufferedReader is used to read tax for our character-based input string,

00:00:53.955 --> 00:00:59.520
it can be used to read data line-by-line by reline method,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.490
it can be also used to read character by character using read method.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.160
When using a BufferedReader,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.700
you want to make sure that you close it before you finish.
