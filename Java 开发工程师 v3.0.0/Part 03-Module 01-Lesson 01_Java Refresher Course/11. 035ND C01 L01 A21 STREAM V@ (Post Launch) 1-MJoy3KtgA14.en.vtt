00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.035
Let's start with string. String is like an endless flow of data.

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:08.205
You can either read for a string or write to a string.

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:14.130
A string is connected to a data source or data destination.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.030
String in File IO can be either byte base or character-based.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:29.100
A program that need to read data from some source needs an input string or reader.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:38.480
A program that need to write data to some destination needs a output string or writer,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.230
which can be shown as the graph like here.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:51.810
So we have the source and we read it using input string or reader by program.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:01:00.460
The program can be right to the output string and writer to the destination.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:08.380
For input string or for output string are common input and output string classes.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.600
For reader and for a writer or common reader are writer classes.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.330
We're going to take a more in next few videos.
