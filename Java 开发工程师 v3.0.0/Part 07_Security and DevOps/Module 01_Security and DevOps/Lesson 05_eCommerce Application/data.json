If you skipped those walkthroughs, we suggest you go back and do them now, and then come back here to finish the remainder of the project.\n\nYou'll start with a template for the complete application, written in Java using Spring Boot, Hibernate ORM, and the H2 database. Your goal will be to take this template and add proper authentication and authorization controls so users can only access their data, and that data can only be accessed in a secure way. You'll do this using a combination of usernames and passwords for authentication, as well as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to handle the authorization.",
