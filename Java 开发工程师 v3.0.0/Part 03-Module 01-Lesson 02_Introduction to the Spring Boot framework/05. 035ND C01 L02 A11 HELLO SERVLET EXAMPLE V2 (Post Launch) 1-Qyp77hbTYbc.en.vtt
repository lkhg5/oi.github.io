00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.375
If you follow the instruction to set up the singlet,

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:05.745
and if you look at the console,

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:12.420
you should see the printed messages we added in our doGET method.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.330
You may realize that, in the example,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.650
we need to add ServletComponentScan and notation to make this application running.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.590
So ServletComponentScan is making the Spring Boot scan for

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.750
the Web Servlet annotation and it's only

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.505
performed when using an embedded web server such as Spring Boot.

00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:39.800
If you're interested to know more,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.770
please take a look at the API document.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.300
In the next video,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.895
we are going to learn what future is,

00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:51.030
and how to implement a future in Spring Boot.
