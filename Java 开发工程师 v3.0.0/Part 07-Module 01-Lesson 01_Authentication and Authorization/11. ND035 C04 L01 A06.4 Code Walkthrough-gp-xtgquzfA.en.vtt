00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
It'll be a good idea to get yourself familiarized with this application,

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.430
which is a e-commerce application,

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.920
and just play around with all the controllers.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.020
So that will give you a fair idea about what the application looks like and what are

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.390
the basic functionalities because we will be using this in order to implement JWT.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.335
The [inaudible] also contains more information about application properties,

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:25.980
which is what we use in order to configure the H2 Database,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.810
which is in-memory database.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.120
I also have data SQL where I have inserted two items

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.720
so that when I run add item to the cart as well as submit,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.795
these are the items that are available for me to

00:00:41.795 --> 00:00:46.000
add so that I don't have to write another API for this.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.060
That was a short walkthrough of this E-commerce application.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.710
I'm sure if you shop online,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.155
this should look very familiar to you.

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:59.950
It will obviously be a good idea to get yourself more familiarized with the controllers.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.580
Let's see how we go ahead and implement JWT into this.
