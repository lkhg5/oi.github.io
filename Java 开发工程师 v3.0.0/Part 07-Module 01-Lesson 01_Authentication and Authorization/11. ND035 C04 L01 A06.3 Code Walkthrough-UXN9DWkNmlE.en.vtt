00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.945
So now we went over getUser as well as CreateUser.

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:09.285
Let's look at one more API here, addToCart.

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:11.580
Again, the process is the same.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.485
We have the CartController,

00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:17.160
we create the endpoint with /API,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.520
but this is the exact path /api/cart.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.570
Then I am using this particular API in order to add to cart.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.470
You can go through this code and you would be able to understand this code

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.935
because this is just a simple Spring Boot application

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:41.875
and all the different components must have been taught to you in the previous course.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:47.255
So this is a good exercise for you to understand the in-depth,

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:48.905
the details as well.

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:52.105
Let's go to the postman again.

00:00:52.105 --> 00:00:54.300
So now I have addToCart,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.380
it's a post request.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.570
So it will take a body. I have already created this body.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.580
I mentioned in addToCart before in the API that it

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.430
takes a username and itemId, and the quantity.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.495
This is what I would use in order to add to my cart.

00:01:15.495 --> 00:01:21.525
So one item whose id is one and the quantity is one.

00:01:21.525 --> 00:01:23.430
When I send this,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.490
I got a 200 okay response again.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.675
Let me pull this up.

00:01:30.675 --> 00:01:33.215
So in the response as you see,

00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:37.760
I have a list of items and I have the user associated with it,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.570
which is me with an id one and this is the total.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.880
Plain and simple. So we have added an item to

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.995
the cart and let's look at submitting this cart.

00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:55.850
So the API for that is submit an order.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.480
Let's look at the IntelliJ part for that.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.075
Here is the OrderController.

00:02:03.075 --> 00:02:06.305
As you see, the endpoint that I can create from this,

00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:12.220
the RequestMapping is /api/order and the PostMapping is submit with username.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.880
This is inside the curly braces,

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.680
which means that I need to replace the actual value in this placeholder.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.470
So let's look at how this is going to look.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.900
So now we have localhost:8080/api/order/submit.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.965
This is my username,

00:02:29.965 --> 00:02:31.925
so that's what I added at the end.

00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:34.510
Now let's look at what this would do.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.680
We have already added items to the cart and I'm going to click "Send".

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.610
This is also returning a 200 okay.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.990
So let me show you what the response looks like over here.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.965
As you see, there is an item id and the id is three,

00:02:54.965 --> 00:03:00.255
which means that before this there were two other ids that exist,

00:03:00.255 --> 00:03:04.065
and there is a list of item which is round widget here.

00:03:04.065 --> 00:03:07.895
There is a user that is associated with this and the total price.

00:03:07.895 --> 00:03:12.170
So that is a response to this submit API,

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.940
which means that we have successfully submitted the cart and placed the order.
