00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.900
In this section, we will learn how to implement

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.350
JWT authentication on a Spring Boot application.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.755
Let's take an example of a Spring Boot application

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:15.375
and see how we can implement JWT on it.

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:18.475
In order to get access to the starter code,

00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:20.975
I'm going to give you access to this link.

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:25.985
The link to this Git repo is going to be provided to you under the video.

00:00:25.985 --> 00:00:32.335
Let's get into cloning this particular repo and look at the starter code in detail.

00:00:32.335 --> 00:00:36.485
What you need to focus on is this clone option.

00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:43.955
What I'm going to do is I will copy the link to clone this repo or repository.

00:00:43.955 --> 00:00:48.960
I'm now going to take the cloned link to my terminal.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.745
For the sake of clarity,

00:00:50.745 --> 00:00:59.760
I'm now going to create a new project directory,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.305
and I'm going to cd into the directory,

00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:07.600
and I will run git clone command.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.080
What git clone does here is,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.225
it downloads the entire repository to your local.

00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:17.510
Now let me show you what I mean by that.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.250
If you run LS on this,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.470
you see the folder is created right here for you.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.670
I'm going to show some

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.810
of the details inside this folder here.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.275
I have access to three projects currently,

00:01:40.275 --> 00:01:42.470
by the time you finish this course,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.315
or you start this particular course,

00:01:44.315 --> 00:01:46.685
you might have more applications.

00:01:46.685 --> 00:01:51.915
However, what you need to look at is P04-eCommerce Application,

00:01:51.915 --> 00:02:02.035
and I'm going to enter this folder to show you the contents of this folder.

00:02:02.035 --> 00:02:05.520
As you see, this is a Maven application,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.015
it has an SRC folder,

00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:14.520
and I will now show the contents of the SRC folder with an intelliJ.
